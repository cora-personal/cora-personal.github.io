									<h1>About Me</h1> 
								</header>
									<p>When I was growing up I wanted to become a medical doctor. I am a 'people person' and a career where I could help people
										and solve probelms made this an obvious career prospect for me. 
										Meanwhile, my love for technology began when I recieved my first laptop and phone (although i missed the Bebo 
										and BBM era unfortunately - or maybe fortunately).
										I found it fascinating what technology could do (and still do), particularly mobile applications. To this day, 
										I use apps for all my interests and hobbies, particularly health and fitness.
										I track my sleep, my food, my steps, etc. Recently, I have put my programming abilities to good use 
										and developed my own solutions and made alterations to existing ones to suit my lifestyle. 
										 <!-- (maybe mention more about laptops etc.)-->
										<br />
										<br />
										At the time of my A-levels, my sights were set on earning a place at medical school. I directed most of my 
										focus to the science subjects
										 but after recieving the 'Best In Year' award for AS ICT, it came to my attention that perhaps my interest in
										  technology could be career choice. I distinctly remember asking my career teacher 'what do you call a person 
										  that makes the software on a phone'. After a lot of consideration I finally decided to enrol 
										  on the Computer Science course in the vibrant city of Liverpool. 
										<br />
										<br />
										It didnâ€™t take many lectures to discover that the problem solving element I craved was a big part of the course.
										 Yes, I wasn't diagnosing poorly patients but instead I was solving problems in my poor-performing code.
										<br />
										My course was a sandwhich course, which meant I had the option to have a placement year in industry.  I was thrilled to spend 
										my year at Novoda, an Digital Product Agency. My placement eradicated my fear that a career in IT would not 
										have the people interaction that a career in medicine would bring. But I was wrong  <!-- (more here.)-->- I loved 
										the office environment and have remained in close contact with many of my colleagues.
										<br />
										Although I have a passion for mobile app development, I really enjoyed learning about all aspects of Computer Science at university. 
										I am self-motivated individual with a growth mind-set, I strive to constantly improve my skills and expand my learning out 
										to other areas in the field.   
										</p>
