									<h1>About Me</h1> 
								</header>
									<p>When I was growing up I wanted to become a medical doctor. I am 'people person' and a career where I could help people
										and solve probelms made this an obvious career prospect for me. 
										My love for technology began when I recieved my first laptop and phone (however i missed the bebo and bbm era unfortunately - or maybe fortunately).
										I found it fascinating what technology could do, particularly mobile applications. And to this day, I use apps for all my interests and hobbies, particularly health and fitness.
										I track my sleep, my food, my steps, etc. Recently, I have put my programming abilities to good use and developed my own solutions and made alterations to existing ones to suit my lifestyle. 
										(maybe mention more about laptops etc.)
										<br />
										<br />
										At the time of my A-levels, my sights were set on earning a at medical school. I directed most of my focus to the science subjects
										 but after recieving the 'Best In Year' award for AS ICT, it came my attention that my interest in technology could be career choice.
										I distinctly remember asking my career teacher 'what do you call a person that makes the software on a phone' and after a lot of consideration and back forth I finally decided to enrol on the Computer Science course in the vibrant city, Liverpool. 
										<br />
										It didn’t take many lectures to discover that the problem solving element I loved was a big part of the course. Yes, I wasn't diagnosing patients to figure out what infection or virus was making them poorly but instead inspecting my code for bugs that were preventing it from being healthy.
										<br />
										My course was a sandwhich course, which meant I had the option to spend a year in industry.  I was thrilled to spend my year at Novoda, an app agency. Another thing placement brought to me was it illuminated my concern that my career would be lonely, I wouldn’t get the people interaction that a career in medicine would bring. But I was wrong- I loved the office environment. I got on really well with my colleagues and I am still in  contact with them today 
										<br />
										Although I have a passion for mobile app development, I really enjoyed all aspects of my course and I am constantly trying to improve my skills and expand my learning to out into other areas in the field.   
										.</p>
