									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
									<p>When I was growing up I wanted to be a doctor. I would have considered myself a 'people person' that loves puzzles and problem solving which lead me to think a doctor was the ovbious career choice for me. It wasn’t until I finally received permission to have my first iphone and laptop, my love for technology began (unfortunately due to my strict parents, I missed the bebo and bbm eras!) I found it fascinating what technology could do, particularly mobile applications. 
										And to this current day I use apps for all my interest and hobbies particularly health and fitness -   I track my sleep, my food, my steps. And recently, using my own programming abilities, I develop my own solutions and making alterations to existing ones to suit my lifestyle. 
										(maybe mention more about laptops etc.)
										<br />
										In school, my sights where set on earning a place to study medicine at university, I focused and worked hard on the science subjects. But after being awarded the best in the year for AS ICT with less effort came more effortlessly to me, it came my attention that my interest in technology could possibly be career choice. I distinctly remember asking my career teacher 'what do you call a person that makes the software on a phone' and after a lot of consideration and back forth I finally decided to enrol on the Computer Science course in the vibrant city, Liverpool. 
										<br />
										It didn’t take many lectures to discover that the problem solving element I loved was a big part of the course. Yes, I wasn't diagnosing patients to figure out what infection or virus was making them poorly but instead inspecting my code for bugs that were preventing it from being healthy.
										<br />
										My course was a sandwhich course, which meant I had the option to spend a year in industry.  I was thrilled to spend my year at Novoda, an app agency. Another thing placement brought to me was it illuminated my concern that my career would be lonely, I wouldn’t get the people interaction that a career in medicine would bring. But I was wrong- I loved the office environment. I got on really well with my colleagues and I am still in  contact with them today 
										<br />
										Although I have a passion for mobile app development, I really enjoyed all aspects of my course and I am constantly trying to improve my skills and expand my learning to out into other areas in the field.
